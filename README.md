# holidays

A flutter app that tells you when is the next holiday.
It is design to work with APIs from [api.gouv.fr](https://api.gouv.fr).

## How to use

1.  You will need to build the app, on the platform of your choice.
2.  On the first launch, you will be redirected to the settings page? There you must set the zone for public holidays and school holidays.
3.  Go to the holiday page.
4.  There'll be two boxes: the first one for the next public holiday, and the second, for the next school holiday.
